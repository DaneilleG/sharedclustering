Shared Clustering is a tool that allows an advanced or expert genetic genealogist to extract more information -- and more useful information -- from [Ancestry DNA](http://www.ancestry.com) shared match lists. Rather than providing a single list of matches ordered only by the strength of the match, Shared Clustering divides that list into smaller clusters of matches that are likely related to each other. Knowing which matches are related to each other can often be a huge help in figuring out how those people are related to you, the test taker.

## Why cluster?

Clustering is a tool, one of many ways that a researcher can hone in on information that they are trying to find. Clustering does not answer genealogical questions on its own. It does, however, provide some extremely focused guidance for further research.

Many people have match lists at Ancestry containing thousands, tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of matches. A dedicated researcher could review thousands of matches individually, given enough time. No human can review hundreds of thousands of matches by hand. A cluster of a few dozen matches is something that anyone can look at easily.

Clusters are most important because a researcher cannot predict where the next lead will come from. The last member of a cluster might be the one person who inherited a family bible from the 1700s. Several members of a cluster might have public trees that share ancestors with the same unusual family name. Or they might share ancestors with family names that vary by spelling, where the similarities are obvious only when you look at them next to each other. Proving the links can be harder... but there's nothing to prove until you find the links in the first place.

## What is a cluster?

Each cluster contains a group of people who are more similar to each other than to other matches. Similarity is determined by the shared match lists of each match. In a _perfect cluster_, every member of the cluster appears in the shared match lists of every other member. Not all clusters are perfect. Clusters reflect biology, and biology is not perfect. The idea behind clusters is similarity, not perfection.

In most cases, a cluster represents a group of people who have some DNA segment shared among them. That makes sense. Clusters are built from the shared match lists reported by Ancestry, and Ancestry builds those lists from the DNA data.

Clusters are displayed visually as red squared in a spreadsheet, along with other identifying information about each match within the cluster:
